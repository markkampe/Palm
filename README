I created this program to convert old palm archive calendar appointments into vcalendar
entries so I could re-import them into a contemporary calendar ... and google calendar
was able to correctly eat this output.

I was going to do the memo, address book, and todo lists to, but then I discovered
that those archives were not in the documented format.  So I left those incomplete
(not having any data to test them against).

I doubt that anyone will ever want or need this again, but here it sits, patiently
waiting.
